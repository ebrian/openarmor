OpenArmor
=========
OpenArmor is a Florida based non-profit organization dedicated to providing educational resources on issues such as security and encryption. In addition to educational resources, OpenArmor also provides tools made in-house as well as tools from third parties to help put what you've learned into practice and help you to communicate, share, store, and distribute anonymously and/or securely. While absolute privacy and security is usually not practical, our tools will severely cripple the efforts of attackers whether they are a crook, hacker, or your own government.

As technology expands and the personal lives of virtually everybody moves online to some degree, the pool of surveillable targets grows at an exponentially increasing rate. This is the perfect setup for unlawful mass data collection and the surveillance of innocent civilians without cause under the guise of "security" or another purpose which would then be used to lead you to believe that being surveilled is in your best interest. The worst part of it all is that it's happening without your knowledge and/or in cooperation with organizations you trust who are required by law to keep quiet.
