OpenArmor
===========
OpenArmor is a Florida based non-profit organization dedicated to providing educational resources on issues such as security and encryption. In addition to educational resources, OpenArmor also provides tools made in-house as well as tools from third parties to help put what you've learned into practice and help you to communicate, share, store, and distribute anonymously and/or securely. While absolute privacy and security is usually not practical, our tools will severely cripple the efforts of attackers whether they are a crook, hacker, or your own government.
