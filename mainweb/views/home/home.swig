            <h2><i class="fa fa-shield"></i> What is OpenArmor?</h2>
            OpenArmor is a Florida based non-profit organization dedicated to providing <a href="/education">educational resources</a> on issues
            such as security and encryption. In addition to educational resources, OpenArmor also provides a collection of <a href="/tools">tools from third parties</a> to help put what you've learned into practice and help you
            to communicate, share, store, and distribute anonymously and/or securely. While absolute privacy and
            security is usually not practical, the tools we highlight here will <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">severely cripple</strong> the
            efforts of attackers whether they are a crook, hacker, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)" target="_blank">your own government</a>.

            <h2><i class="fa fa-question"></i> Why should I care?</h2>
            As technology expands and the personal lives of virtually everybody moves online to some degree, the pool of surveillable targets
            grows at an <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">exponentially increasing rate</strong>. This is the perfect setup for unlawful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)" target="_blank">mass data collection</a> and the surveillance
            of innocent civilians without cause under the guise of "security" or another purpose which would then be used to lead you
            to believe that being surveilled is in your best interest. The worst part of it all is that it's happening without your
            knowledge and/or in cooperation with organizations you trust who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter" target="_blank">are required by law to keep quiet</a>.

            <h2><i class="fa fa-gavel"></i> Is OpenArmor legal?</h2>
            In the United States of America, absolutely! In other countries, it depends. As Americans, you are guaranteed certain rights under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution" target="_blank">United States Constitution</a>.
            Of those, OpenArmor deals primarily with your 1st Amendment right to Freedom of Speech and your 4th Amendment right prohibiting
            unreasonable searches and seizures. Now, this does not mean the United States Constitution is followed absolutely, which is,
            of course, why OpenArmor must exist in the first place. One thing is for sure: Constitution or not, OpenArmor will help protect you.
